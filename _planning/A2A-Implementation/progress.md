- REST and WebSocket endpoints setup
- Database initialization automation

### Feature Slice 2: Agent Communication ✅
- WebSocket-based real-time communication between agents
- Message routing with @mention support
- Task event broadcasting system
- Error recovery and reconnection logic
- Client-side message composition with A2A support
- Type-safe message handling

### Feature Slice 3: Context Sharing ✅
- Implemented SharedContext model with proper relationships

- Added comprehensive test suite for all functionality

## Current Status

### Technical Implementation
- WebSocket connections are stable and tested
- Message routing is functioning correctly
- UI updates in real-time as expected
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms are in place
- Type safety is enforced throughout the system
- Context sharing and management fully operational
- All tests passing for context sharing functionality

### Code Organization
- Backend: 
  - api_gateway/src/routes/ws_a2a.py for A2A WebSocket endpoints
  - api_gateway/src/routes/context.py for context management endpoints
  - api_gateway/src/services/context_service.py for context business logic
  - api_gateway/src/models/shared_context.py for context data model
- Frontend: 
  - src/services/websocket.ts for client-side WebSocket handling
  - src/services/context.ts for context API integration
  - src/components/ui/chat-input.tsx for A2A message composition
  - src/components/ui/context-indicator.tsx for context status display
  - src/components/ui/context-viewer.tsx for context visualization
- Types: src/types/api.ts for type definitions

### Success Metrics Met
- WebSocket latency < 50ms ✅
- Message routing < 100ms ✅
- Error rate < 1% ✅
- Clean architecture maintained ✅
- Context sharing latency < 100ms ✅
- Filtering accuracy > 95% ✅
- Test coverage > 80% ✅

## Next Work: Feature Slice 4 - Conversation Checkpoints

### High Priority Tasks
1. Database Schema Implementation

   - [ ] Add database indexes for performance

2. Checkpoint Service Implementation
   - [ ] Implement automatic checkpoint creation logic
   - [ ] Add manual checkpoint creation support
   - [ ] Create checkpoint summarization service
   - [ ] Set up checkpoint retrieval with filtering
   - [ ] Add checkpoint management (update, delete)

3. API Layer Development
   - [ ] Create checkpoint endpoints with validation
   - [ ] Add checkpoint retrieval with filtering
   - [ ] Implement summarization endpoints
   - [ ] Add checkpoint management endpoints
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling

### Medium Priority Tasks
1. Client-Side Implementation
   - [ ] Create checkpoint visualization components
   - [ ] Add checkpoint management UI
   - [ ] Implement real-time updates
   - [ ] Add error handling and recovery

2. Testing and Validation
   - [ ] Write unit tests for checkpoint service

   - [ ] Perform performance testing

### Low Priority Tasks
1. Analytics and Monitoring
   - [ ] Add checkpoint usage tracking
   - [ ] Implement performance metrics
   - [ ] Create usage reports
   - [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE checkpoints (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    summary TEXT,
    message_ids JSON,
    metadata JSON,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_by TEXT,
    is_auto BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY(session_id) REFERENCES chat_sessions(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(created_by) REFERENCES agent_cards(agent_id)
);

CREATE INDEX ix_checkpoints_session_id ON checkpoints(session_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_checkpoints_created_at ON checkpoints(created_at);
```

### Dependencies
- SQLite with JSON1 extension
- SQLAlchemy for ORM
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- TanStack Query for client-state

### Timeline
- Database Implementation: 1 day
