# SQLite Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to completely remove SQLite from the codebase and standardize on LMDB.

## Changes Made

1. **Environment Settings**
   - Updated `.env` file to set `DB_TYPE=lmdb` and removed `DATABASE_URL`
   - Updated `.env.example` to show LMDB as the only supported database

2. **Code Changes**
   - Modified `db_factory.py` to only import from `db_lmdb.py` and not allow fallback to SQLite
   - Created a compatibility `db.py` that simply re-exports all functions from `db_lmdb.py`
   - Removed the original SQLite-based `db.py` implementation
   - Renamed `init_db.py` to `legacy_init_sqlite.py` for historical reference

3. **Migration Script Updates**
   - Modified `migrate_sqlite_to_lmdb.py` to clearly indicate SQLite removal
   - Added code to automatically update environment settings after migration
   - Updated script documentation to clarify this is a one-way migration

4. **Utility Scripts**
   - Updated `set_database_type.py` to only accept "lmdb" as a valid option
   - Renamed `apply_lmdb_migration.sh` to `setup_lmdb.sh` to reflect its new purpose
   - Modified script to remove references to SQLite rollback options

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated `claude.md` to reflect LMDB as the database framework instead of SQLite
   - Updated various comments and docstrings to indicate LMDB exclusivity

## Benefits of LMDB

- **Performance**: Memory-mapped files provide better read/write performance
- **Concurrency**: Better handling of multiple processes/threads
- **Flexibility**: Key-value store allows for more flexible data modeling
- **Simplicity**: Simpler code structure without SQL syntax
- **Durability**: ACID transactions ensure data integrity

## Migration Process

The migration from SQLite to LMDB is handled by:

1. Setting environment variable `DB_TYPE=lmdb`
2. Running `force_init_lmdb.py` to initialize LMDB database structure
3. Running `migrate_sqlite_to_lmdb.py` to transfer existing data
4. Testing with `test_lmdb.py` to ensure functionality

After migration, the system works exclusively with LMDB and SQLite support has been completely removed.
