# Multiagent Chat System UI Documentation

This document describes the user interface of the multiagent chat system, as depicted in the provided screenshot. The interface allows users to interact with multiple AI agents within different chat conversations.

## Interface Overview

The UI is divided into three main sections:

1.  **Conversations Sidebar (Left):** Manages chat sessions.
2.  **Chat Area (Center):** Displays the current conversation and agent interactions.
3.  **Input Area (Bottom):** Allows the user to compose and send messages, potentially selecting specific agents.

## Components

### 1. Conversations Sidebar

*   **Title:** "Conversations"
*   **New Chat Button:** A prominent button to initiate a new chat session.
*   **Chat List:** Displays a list of existing chat sessions (e.g., "New Chat", "New Chat", etc.). Clicking on a chat likely switches the main Chat Area to that conversation.
*   **Library:** Located at the bottom of the sidebar, labeled "Library (2)". Its exact function isn't clear from the static image but might relate to saved resources, prompts, or agents.

### 2. Chat Area

*   **Title:** Displays the name of the current chat (e.g., "Tucker's Team").
*   **Dark Mode Toggle:** An icon (crescent moon) in the top-right corner, presumably to switch between light and dark themes.
*   **Message Display:**
    *   Shows the flow of the conversation chronologically.
    *   **User Messages:** Appear aligned to the right (e.g., "hello", "@phil_connors hello"). The "@" symbol suggests the ability to directly address specific agents.
    *   **Agent Messages:** Appear aligned to the left, each associated with a specific agent identified by an icon and name.
        *   **Chloe (Green Icon):** An agent introducing itself and offering assistance, particularly with git operations.
        *   **phil_connors (Orange Icon):** An agent specializing in weather.
    *   Vertical colored lines next to agent messages might indicate the agent currently "speaking" or differentiate between agents visually.

### 3. Input Area

*   **Agent Selection Icons:** A row of icons (green, grey, orange, purple, blue) likely representing the available agents (Chloe, Architect, and others) that the user can interact with or select before sending a message. The greyed-out icon might represent a disabled or inactive agent.
*   **Text Input Field:** A multi-line text area prompting the user to "Type a message... (Shift+Enter for new line)".
*   **Send Button:** Sends the composed message to the selected agent(s) or the general chat.
*   **Upload Button:** An icon (upward arrow) to the left of the text input, likely for uploading files or attachments.

## Functionality (Inferred)

*   **Multi-Conversation Management:** Users can create and switch between multiple independent chat sessions.
*   **Multi-Agent Interaction:** Users can converse with a team of specialized AI agents within a single chat.
*   **Agent Addressing:** Users can potentially direct messages to specific agents using "@" mentions.
*   **Agent Selection:** Users might be able to select which agent(s) should respond to their next message using the icons.
*   **Rich Input:** Supports multi-line text input and potentially file uploads.
*   **Customization:** Offers a dark mode option.

This documentation provides a description based on the visual elements in the screenshot. Further details would require interaction with the live application or access to its source code/design specifications.
