# Socket.IO Implementation Test Fixes

This document summarizes the work done to fix test failures in the backend API Gateway related to Socket.IO implementation.

## Issues Fixed

1. **MessageType enum handling in socket_message_handler.py**
   - Fixed the socket_message_handler.py to properly import and use the MessageType enum from models/messages.py
   - Replaced string literals for message types with proper MessageType enum values
   - This fixes the "str object has no attribute 'name'" error in chat_service.save_message

2. **Context Service Database Integration**
   - Added proper fixtures for testing with SQLite database
   - Created a setup_test_database fixture that properly sets up the database with test data
   - Fixed database foreign key constraint errors in context_service tests

3. **Missing Imports in Tests**
   - Added missing 'time' import in socket_service.py test
   - Added missing 'SocketErrorHandler' class import in test_socket_service.py

4. **Datetime Handling**
   - Fixed timezone-aware vs naive datetime comparison issues in context TTL tests
   - Used monkeypatching to provide consistent datetime behavior in tests

## Remaining Work

1. **Socket.IO Integration Tests**
   - Fix socket integration tests that rely on proper Socket.IO server mocking
   - Update test expectations to match actual implementation

2. **Context Sharing Tests**
   - Update context_sharing.py tests to work with database instead of in-memory structure
   - Fix API compatibility issues in test assertions

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Prepare and submit PR with all test fixes
   - Add documentation comments explaining key changes

## Next Steps

1. Focus on fixing the Socket.IO integration tests
2. Create mock WebSocket clients for proper testing
3. Update context_sharing tests to work with new database structure
4. Ensure all tests pass before creating the PR

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in fixing the backend tests. The most critical issues with foreign key constraints and type errors have been resolved, allowing the basic context service tests to pass successfully. The remaining work involves fixing integration tests and context sharing tests.
