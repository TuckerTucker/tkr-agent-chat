architecture:

    state: "TanStack Query for managing server state cache, React state/context for local UI state (e.g., active session ID, theme)."
    # Updated data flow for server-side persistence
    data_flow: "UI Events -> API Call (React Query Mutation) / WebSocket -> API Gateway (DB Persistence, ADK Runner) -> WebSocket -> React Query Cache Invalidation -> UI Update"
    error_handling: "Error Boundaries per major UI section, toast notifications for transient errors, React Query error handling."
    component_development: "Storybook stories with shadcn/ui components"
  scalability:
    real_time:
      strategy: "WebSockets for message passing"
      rationale: "Essential for real-time chat updates between user and agents."
    state_management:
      strategy: "TanStack Query caching and background updates. WebSocket invalidates relevant queries."

          assets/                # Static assets (e.g., avatar image file)
  config_and_metadata:
    - id: "Unique agent identifier"
    - name: "Display name"
    - description: "Short description of the agent"
    - color: "UI theming color (Hex format, e.g., #RRGGBB)"
    - capabilities: "List of supported features/tools"
    - optional: ["icon_path (path to avatar file in assets/)", "version"]
  tools: "Each agent has its own tools/ directory for modular tool implementations. Tools are registered with the agent via the tools property."
  prompts: "Prompt logic is modular and file-based (prompt.py), supporting easy customization and extension."
  testing: "Unit tests are required for agent logic and tools, located in tests/."
  integration: # Updated for ADK Streaming Model
    runner: "Agents are loaded by the API Gateway and executed using the google-adk Runner."
    ui: "Agent metadata is exposed via a REST endpoint (/api/v1/agents). Chat interaction occurs via a direct WebSocket connection per agent (/ws/v1/chat/{session_id}/{agent_id}) managed by the API Gateway, which uses the ADK Runner internally."
    events: "Agent responses (text chunks, turn completion) are streamed directly to the UI via the WebSocket connection."
  best_practices:
    - "Keep each agent self-contained and modular."
    - "Use clear, documented configuration for UI integration."
    - "Write unit tests for all core logic and tools."
    - "Document agent capabilities and usage in README.md."
    - "Prefer composition (tools, prompts) over inheritance for extensibility."

  mcp_tools:
    architecture: |
      MCP tools are implemented using the Python SDK and included in each agent's tools/ directory.
      - Prefer an MCP server per agent for modularity and isolation.
      - For lightweight or tightly-coupled agents, a shared server may be considered.
    interface:
      options:
        - stateless_function: "Simple, easy to test, no side effects. Cannot maintain state between invocations."
        - class: "Encapsulates logic, easy to extend, supports dependency injection. Still stateless unless state is persisted externally."
        - persistent_object: "Maintains state across invocations (e.g., cache, session). Use only when necessary; harder to test."
      recommendation: "Default to stateless functions or lightweight classes. Use persistent objects only if stateful behavior is required."
    discovery: "Tools are auto-registered by scanning the tools/ directory at agent startup. Use naming conventions or decorators to mark tool entry points."
    config: "Tools are configured per agent and do not support runtime configuration by default."
    invocation: "Tools are invoked internally by the agent logic (e.g., via ADK's function calling or direct calls), not via MCP." # Updated invocation
    error_handling: |
      - Catch and handle all exceptions within tool logic.
      - Return structured error responses via MCP protocol (error code, message).
      - Avoid leaking stack traces or sensitive info to the client.
    logging: |
      - Log tool invocations, errors, and important events using Python's logging module.
      - Use per-agent log files or structured logging for easier debugging.
    testing: |
      - Write unit tests for each tool in tools/tests/ or tests/.
      - Test both normal and error cases.
      - Use mocks for external dependencies.
