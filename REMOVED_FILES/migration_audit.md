# Socket.IO Migration Audit

This document outlines the detailed audit performed to ensure all raw WebSocket components have been properly replaced with Socket.IO.

## Removed Files

* `/src/services/websocket.ts`
* `/src/services/__tests__/websocket.test.ts`
* `/api_gateway/src/routes/ws.py`
* `/api_gateway/src/routes/ws_a2a.py`
* `/api_gateway/src/tests/routes/test_ws_routes.py`

## Updated Files

### Frontend

* `/src/App.tsx` - Updated imports and method calls
* `/src/hooks/useConnectionNotifications.ts` - Updated import and service references
* `/src/hooks/useAgentStatuses.ts` - Updated import and service references
* `/src/services/context.ts` - Updated import and removed WebSocket references
* `/src/test/setup.ts` - Replaced WebSocket mock with Socket.IO mock

### Backend

* `/api_gateway/src/main.py` - Removed WebSocket route imports and registrations, added proper Socket.IO integration
* `/api_gateway/src/services/state.py` - Updated to legacy module with warnings and dummy methods

## Legacy Components

The following components are kept for backward compatibility but are no longer actively used:

* `SharedState` class in `api_gateway/src/services/state.py` - Converted to a legacy module with dummy methods
* WebSocket imports in `setup.ts` - Replaced with Socket.IO mocks

## Socket.IO Implementation

The new Socket.IO implementation consists of:

### Frontend
* `/src/services/socket-service.ts` - Complete Socket.IO client implementation

### Backend
* `/api_gateway/src/services/socket_service.py` - Socket.IO server implementation
* `/api_gateway/src/services/socket_connection_manager.py` - Connection management
* `/api_gateway/src/services/socket_message_handler.py` - Message routing and validation
* `/api_gateway/src/services/socket_error_handler.py` - Error management

## TypeScript Type Updates

All WebSocket-related types have been replaced with Socket.IO types:

* `AgentStatus` type moved from websocket.ts to socket-service.ts
* `ConnectionStatus` type moved to socket-service.ts
* `A2AMessage` type moved to socket-service.ts

## Testing Updates

Tests have been updated to:
* Mock Socket.IO instead of WebSocket
* Use Socket.IO-specific assertions
* Replace WebSocket event listeners with Socket.IO event listeners

## Conclusion

The audit confirms that all raw WebSocket usage has been successfully replaced with Socket.IO. Any remaining WebSocket references are either:
1. In disabled/legacy code properly marked as deprecated
2. In Socket.IO configuration (where "websocket" is mentioned as a transport option)
3. In test mocks that have been updated for Socket.IO

The migration is complete and the system is now using Socket.IO exclusively for real-time communication.
